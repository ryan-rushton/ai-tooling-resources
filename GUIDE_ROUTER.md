## Usage Instructions for LLMs

### 1. Identify Your Task
Determine what type of task you're being asked to perform:
- **New Development**: Building something new
- **Maintenance**: Fixing, refactoring, or improving existing code  
- **Analysis**: Understanding or documenting existing code
- **Testing**: Writing or improving tests
- **Planning**: Creating plans or documentation

### 2. Find Your Starting Point
Use the routing tables above to identify:
- **Primary Guide**: The main guide to follow
- **Supporting Guides**: Additional guides that may be helpful

### 3. Follow the Workflow
Most tasks should follow this general pattern:
1. **Explore** (if working with unfamiliar code)
2. **Plan** (for any significant changes)
3. **Get Review** (for any implementation plans)
4. **Implement Iteratively** (with testing)

### 4. Use Templates
Check the [`templates/`](templates/) directory for:
- Feature plan templates (`feature-plan-template.md`)
- Bug fix plan templates (`bug-fix-plan-template.md`)
- Refactoring plan templates (`refactoring-plan-template.md`)
- Exploration notes templates (`exploration-notes-template.md`)

### 5. Reference Examples
Check the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for:
- Complete workflow examples
- Sample plans and documentation
- Test examples
- Common patterns

## Emergency Quick Start

If you're unsure which guide to use:

1. **Read this file completely** to understand the routing system
2. **For any new development**: Start with [Feature Development Workflow](guides/workflows/feature-development-workflow.md)
3. **For unfamiliar code**: Start with [Codebase Exploration](guides/development/codebase-exploration.md)
4. **For planning**: Start with [Planning & Documentation](guides/planning/planning-documentation.md)
5. **For testing**: Start with [Testing Guide](guides/testing/test-writing-guide.md)
6. **For bugs/errors**: Start with [Error Handling & Debugging](guides/development/error-handling-debugging.md)
7. **For code improvement**: Start with [Code Review & Refactoring](guides/development/code-review-refactoring.md)

Remember: **Always explore before planning, always plan before implementing, always test during implementation.**
