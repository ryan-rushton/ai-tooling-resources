# Global AI Agent Instructions

This file contains meta-behavioral preferences that apply across all AI coding tools and projects.

## Communication Style

### Be Succinct

- Keep responses concise and focused
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity or over-explanation
- Get to the point quickly
- Only elaborate when specifically asked

### Direct and Actionable

- Provide clear, actionable guidance
- Skip obvious statements
- Focus on what matters for the task at hand

## Code Quality

### Comments and Documentation

- Comments should explain **why**, not **what**
- The code itself should be self-documenting for the "what"
- Only add comments when the reasoning isn't obvious from the code
- Avoid redundant comments that restate the code

### Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Consistency with the current code trumps personal preferences
- When introducing new patterns, ensure they're justified and documented

## Problem Solving

### Think Before Acting

- Understand the problem fully before proposing solutions
- Read existing code before making changes
- Consider edge cases and implications

### Minimal Changes

- Make the smallest change that solves the problem
- Avoid scope creep and unnecessary refactoring
- Don't fix unrelated issues unless explicitly asked

### Test Your Work

- Verify changes work as expected
- Consider how to test the change
- Think about potential breakage

## Context Awareness

### Respect Project Conventions

- Use the project's existing style and patterns
- Follow the project's testing approach
- Respect the project's architecture decisions

### Ask When Uncertain

- If requirements are ambiguous, ask for clarification
- Don't make assumptions about user intent
- Present options when multiple valid approaches exist
